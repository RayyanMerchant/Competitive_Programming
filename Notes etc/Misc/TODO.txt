TODO - :

1. Implement solutions to problem C and problem D of recent codeforces Div 3 round.

2. Study DP subsequence problems like LIS and try https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/977/F.

3. Bipartite graph :
	to undestand teh editorial of A problem here : https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/5285
	even though I have solved the problem even then learn bipartite graph to understand the
	terminology used.
	
4. Graph topics left to learn
		1. Implement Tarjan for strongly connected components
		2. Topological Sort
		3. Dijkstra 
		4. Floyd-warshall
		5. Bellman Ford
		6. Kruskal Spanning Tree
		7. Prims Spanning Tree
		8. Articulation Points and Biconnected Graphs
		9. Graph colouring eg: 2 colours, bipartite graph etc

			Maximum flow
			Minimum Cost Maximum Flow
			Min-cut




5. Tree Topics left to learn
		1. Euler Tour
		2. LCA(Lowest Common Ancestor)
